tenace (0.7) upstream; urgency=low

    --prefix. Thanks to Mark Voorhies for spotting.
  * Add contrib/bonded.svg for convenience.
  * Board list can be reordered via the options menu.

tenace (0.6) upstream; urgency=low

  * Solver:
    + Always use dealt cards for parscore computation.
    + Parscore computation was broken when S makes more tricks than N.
  * UI:
    + Move fast forward/rewind to menu, make to buttons go one trick
      forward/backward, and generally reorder menu.
    + Support dragging to/from card window.
    + Implement options window and read/write ~/.config/tenacerc as keyfile.
    + Card filename and rendering size are now configurable.
    + Sort recently used files by time.
  * Hand widget: Start dragging manually to prevent dragging 'x' and empty
    cards.
  * Examples: Add squeeze.lin.
