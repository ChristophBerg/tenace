tenace
======

Tenace is a Bridge hand viewer and editor.

http://www.df7cb.de/bridge/tenace/

Requirements
------------

Tenace was written on Debian GNU/Linux, but should run on any *NIX platform
that features GTK+. Recommended minimum version is 2.12 due to the usage of
GtkTooltip. Tenace will still compile with older versions, but some features
will be disabled, notably the recently-used boards menu and tooltip popups for
alert explanations. To render images of cards, librsvg is used (though
optional).

Tenace uses Bo Haglund's excellent DDS double dummy solver library for
discovering optimal leads and computing parscores.

Installation
------------

Get and unpack the tarball.
$ ./configure --help
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Translations
------------

Currently, there's only a German translation, feel free to submit more. (For
technical reason, there's also an English translation that only contains four
strings, though real en_US/en_GB translations would be welcome as well.)

Feedback and Bugs
-----------------

I'd be happy to hear back from you, either by mail, or using the Debian bug
tracking system. I'm Myon on BBO, feel free to say hello there.
