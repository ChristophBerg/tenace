tenace
======

Tenace is a Bridge hand viewer and editor.

http://www.df7cb.de/bridge/tenace/

Requirements
------------

Tenace was written on Debian GNU/Linux, but should run on any *NIX platform
that features GTK+. Recommended minimum version is 2.12 due to the usage of
GtkTooltip. Tenace will still compile with older versions, but some features
will be disabled, notably the recently-used boards menu and tooltip popups for
alert explanations. To render images of cards, librsvg is used (though
optional).

Installation
------------

Get and unpack the tarball.
$ ./configure --help
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Translations
------------

Currently, there's only a German translation, feel free to submit more. (For
technical reason, there's also an English translation that only contains four
strings, though real en_US/en_GB translations would be welcome as well.)

Feedback and Bugs
-----------------

I'd be happy to hear back from you, either by mail, or using the Debian bug
tracking system. I'm Myon on BBO, feel free to say hello there.
