tenace
======

Tenace is a Bridge hand viewer and editor.

http://www.df7cb.de/bridge/tenace/

Requirements
------------

Tenace was written on Debian GNU/Linux, but should run on any *NIX platform
that features GTK+. Minimum version required is 2.12 due to the usage of
GtkTooltip. To render images of cards, librsvg is used (though optional).

Installation
------------

Get and unpack the tarball.
$ ./configure --help
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Feedback and Bugs
-----------------

I'd be happy to hear back from you, either by mail, or using the Debian bug
tracking system.
