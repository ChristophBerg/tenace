Notes on the tenace examples
============================

Notes on the "Everybody makes" deals can be found at Thomas Andrew's site and
in an article by Richard Pavlicek:

triple-coup.lin is an interesting deal where South can make 7H on a Spade lead.

7nt-south.lin is a hand where South makes 7NT, but North does not, and no hand
has a void. (Otherwise, the example is trivial to contruct.) By Christian
LÃ¶wenstein.
